# SkipKit

This [Skip Lite](https://skip.tools) module enhances the `SkipUI` package with commonly-used features,
such as a permission checker and a picker for photos and other media.

## Setup

To include this framework in your project, add the following
dependency to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    name: "my-package",
    products: [
        .library(name: "MyProduct", targets: ["MyTarget"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://source.skip.tools/skip-kit.git", "0.0.0"..<"2.0.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
            .product(name: "SkipKit", package: "skip-kit")
        ])
    ]
)
```

## Cache

The `Cache<Key, Value>` class manages a memory-pressure-aware cache that can be
used for storing temporary values.

Example usage:

```swift
// Create a cache that can store up to 100 bytes of Data instances
// and will evict everything when the app is put in the background
let cache = Cache<UUID, Data>(evictOnBackground: true, limit: 100, cost: \.count)

cache.putValue(Data(count: 1), for: UUID()) // total cost = 1
cache.putValue(Data(count: 99), for: UUID()) // total cost = 100
cache.putValue(Data(count: 1), for: UUID()) // total cost = 101, so cache will evict older entries
```


## PermissionManager

The `PermissionManager` provides the ability to request device permissions.

For example:

```swift
import SkipKit
import SkipDevice

let locationProvider = LocationProvider()

if await PermissionManager.requestPermission(.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) == true {
    let location = try await locationProvider.fetchCurrentLocation()
}
```

In addition to symbolic constants, there are also functions for requesting
specific permissions with various parameters:

```swift
static func queryLocationPermission(precise: Bool, always: Bool) -> PermissionAuthorization
static func requestLocationPermission(precise: Bool, always: Bool) async -> PermissionAuthorization

static func queryPostNotificationPermission() async -> PermissionAuthorization
static func requestPostNotificationPermission(alert: Bool = true, sound: Bool = true, badge: Bool = true) async throws -> PermissionAuthorization

static func queryCameraPermission() -> PermissionAuthorization
static func requestCameraPermission() async -> PermissionAuthorization

static func queryRecordAudioPermission() -> PermissionAuthorization
static func requestRecordAudioPermission() async -> PermissionAuthorization

static func queryContactsPermission(readWrite: Bool) -> PermissionAuthorization
static func requestContactsPermission(readWrite: Bool) async throws -> PermissionAuthorization

static func queryCalendarPermission(readWrite: Bool) -> PermissionAuthorization
static func requestCalendarPermission(readWrite: Bool) async throws -> PermissionAuthorization

static func queryReminderPermission(readWrite: Bool) -> PermissionAuthorization
static func requestReminderPermission(readWrite: Bool) async throws -> PermissionAuthorization

static func queryPhotoLibraryPermission(readWrite: Bool) -> PermissionAuthorization
static func requestPhotoLibraryPermission(readWrite: Bool) async -> PermissionAuthorization
```

To request an arbitrary Android permission for which there may be no
iOS equivalent, you can pass the string literal. For a list of common permission literals, see
[https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission).

For example, to request the SMS sending permission:

```swift
let granted = await PermissionManager.requestPermission("android.permission.SEND_SMS")
```

## Camera and Media selection

The `View.withMediaPicker(type:isPresented:selectedImageURL:)` extension function
can be used to enable the acquisition of an image from either the system camera 
or the user's media library. 

On iOS, this camera selector will be presented in a `fullScreenCover` view, 
whereas the media library browser will be presented in a `sheet`. In both cases,
a standad `UIImagePickerController` will be used to acquire the media.

On Android, the camera and library browser will be activated through 
an Intent after querying for the necessary permissions.

Following is an example of implementing a media selection button that 
will bring up the system user interface.

```swift
import SkipKit

/// A button that enables the selection of media from the library or the taking of a photo.
///
/// The selected/captured image will be communicated through the `selectedImageURL` binding,
/// which can be observed with `onChange` to perform an action when the media URL is acquired.
struct MediaButton : View {
    let type: MediaPickerType // either .camera or .library
    @Binding var selectedImageURL: URL?
    @State private var showPicker = false

    var body: some View {
        Button(type == .camera ? "Take Photo" : "Select Media") {
            showPicker = true // activate the media picker
        }
        .withMediaPicker(type: .camera, isPresented: $showPicker, selectedImageURL: $selectedImageURL)
    }
}
```

### Camera and Media Permissions

In order to access the device's photos or media library, you will need to 
declare the permissions in the app's metadata.

On iOS this can be done by editing the `Darwin/AppName.xcconfig` file and adding the lines:

```
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSCameraUsageDescription = "This app needs to access the camera";
INFOPLIST_KEY_NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription = "This app needs to access the photo library.";
```

On Android, the `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file will need to be edited to include 
camera permissions as well as a FileProvider implementation so the camera can share a Uri with the app. For example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android" xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
    <!-- features and permissions needed in order to use the camera and read/write photos -->
    <uses-feature
        android:name="android.hardware.camera"
        android:required="false" />
    <uses-feature
        android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"
        android:required="false" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    <application
        android:label="${PRODUCT_NAME}"
        android:name=".AndroidAppMain"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher">
        <activity
            android:name=".MainActivity"
            android:exported="true"
            android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|keyboardHidden|mnc|colorMode|density|fontScale|fontWeightAdjustment|keyboard|layoutDirection|locale|mcc|navigation|smallestScreenSize|touchscreen|uiMode"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.DayNight.NoActionBar"
            android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
        <!-- needed in order for the camera to be able to share the photo with the app -->
        <provider
            android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
            android:authorities="${applicationId}.fileprovider"
            android:exported="false"
            android:grantUriPermissions="true">
            <meta-data
                android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                android:resource="@xml/file_paths" />
        </provider>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

In addition to editing the manifest, you must also manually create the `xml/file_paths` reference from the manifest's provider. This is done by creating the folder `Android/app/src/main/res/xml` in your Skip project and adding a file `file_paths.xml` with the following contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<paths>
    <external-path name="my_images" path="." />
    <cache-path name="*" path="." />
</paths>
```

For an example of a properly configured project, see the Photo Chat sample application.

## Document Picker

The `View.withDocumentPicker(isPresented: Binding<Bool>, allowedContentTypes: [UTType], selectedDocumentURL: Binding<URL?>, selectedFilename: Binding<String?>, selectedFileMimeType: Binding<String?>)` extension function can be used to select a document of the specified UTType from the device to use in the App. 

On iOS it will use an instance of `FileImporter` to display the system file picker, essentially allowing to select a file from the Files application, while on Android it relies on the the system document picker via the Activity result for the `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`. Once the user selects a file it will receive an `uri`, that need to be parsed to be used outside the scope of the caller. For doing so it will copy the file inside the App cache folder and expose the cached url instead of the original picked file url. 

For example:

```swift
Button("Pick Document") {
    presentPreview = true
}
.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
.withDocumentPicker(isPresented: $presentPreview, allowedContentTypes: [.image, .pdf], selectedDocumentURL: $selectedDocument, selectedFilename: $filename, selectedFileMimeType: $mimeType)
```

## Document Preview

The `View.withDocumentPreview(isPresented: Binding<Bool>, documentURL: URL?, filename: String?, type: String?)` extension function can be used to preview a document available to the app (either selected with the provided `Document Picker` or downloaded locally by the App). 
On iOS it will use an instance of `QLPreviewController` to display the file at the provided url while on Android it will open an Intent chooser for selecting the appropriate app for the provided file mime type. 
On iOS there's no need to provide a filename or a mime type, but sometimes on Android is necessary (for example when selecting a document using the document picker). On Android if no mime type is supplied it will try to guess it by the file url. If no mime type can be found the application chooser will be empty. 
A file provider (like the one used for using the `MediaPicker`) is necessary for the Intent to correctly pass reading permission to the receiving app. As long as your Skip already implements the FileProvider and the `file_paths.xml` as described in the `Camera and Media Permission` section there's nothing else needed, otherwise you need to follow the instructions in the mentioned section. 

## Building

This project is a free Swift Package Manager module that uses the
[Skip](https://skip.tools) plugin to transpile Swift into Kotlin.

Building the module requires that Skip be installed using 
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with `brew install skiptools/skip/skip`.
This will also install the necessary build prerequisites:
Kotlin, Gradle, and the Android build tools.

## Testing

The module can be tested using the standard `swift test` command
or by running the test target for the macOS destination in Xcode,
which will run the Swift tests as well as the transpiled
Kotlin JUnit tests in the Robolectric Android simulation environment.

Parity testing can be performed with `skip test`,
which will output a table of the test results for both platforms.
